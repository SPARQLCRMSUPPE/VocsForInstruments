Beyond the Silos of the LAMs: Collaboration Among Libraries, Archives and Museums

 

The Vision and Network Trends

The “ideal world” discussions evoked in the above composite successfully framed more concrete
conversations about collaborative possibilities. Envisioning the ideal information landscape quickly
focused thinking on how LAMs could better support users. Participants elevated their thinking from
their own LAM unit to a campus level.

The information environment that emerged in the visioning exercise reflects a world in which LAMs
make their campus Web presence more compelling through collaboration, which they hope will
allow them to operate at the “center of the information commons.” Yet even as participants
discussed this scenario, they acknowledged that the traffic and engagement they would like to
foster locally has increasingly moved elsewhere on the Web, and may be impossible to recapture. As
one participant acknowledged:

“In the meantime, the outside world is largely unaware of what [we have] because they’re not
hitting it through the search engines. They’re not stumbling across it in the way that they work,
which is to start from Google rather than say, oh, | must go to [this campus] Web site.”

LAMs are increasingly aware that they are not primary Web destinations and that most users are
directed to resources through search engines or through portals specific to their areas of interest.
They also see that much of the social interaction they hope will take place on their sites now occurs
in community networking spaces such as Flickr® and Facebook.

While some LAMs are trying to ameliorate this situation by putting their content where the users are
(for example, by adding links to Wikipedia pages or placing images on Flickr), these efforts are
exploratory and have not yet altered the fundamental strategy for collection access or the primacy of
the campus Web site. The discussion exposed an underlying tension between the vision of seamless
collections access and community engagement on local Web sites, and the shift in online user
behavior where access and engagement now occur at a broader network level.
