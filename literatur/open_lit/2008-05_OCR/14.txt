Beyond the Silos of the LAMs: Collaboration Among Libraries, Archives and Museums

 

“person-to-person” process that depends on “knowing who to call.” A digital work environment
facilitates processes associated with activities such as exhibitions, conservation or publications,
“making things flow internally.” Research and development “sandboxes” for experimentation yield
spin-off activities leading to further areas of convergence.

Users add their knowledge to information resources through mechanisms such as social tagging or
community annotation. These social systems enhance the utility of the materials presented, while
enriching and supporting the institutional descriptive effort by “absorbing community knowledge.”
Innovative and evocative means of user engagement enables the capture of “the associative
responses to collections, not just the facts about them.” This engagement preserves the moment of
inspiration, the emotional response, the enthusiasm or the reminiscence generated by interactions
with collections, thereby demonstrating the ability of collections to inspire creativity and forge
connections around the human experience. “cultural commons” clusters information around
subjects, objects and people to create “a more holistic approach” that integrates the physical and
virtual user experience.

New services arise within institutions to manage all information resources in a more streamlined
fashion. A centralized backend support system for all digital assets ensures that digital production
is consistently maintained, serviced and made available. Such a system could “separate the file
system from services,” allowing the storage of data in a single environment, while all LAMs can
manage the data in whatever system or interface they prefer.

With the ever-increasing acquisition of born-digital materials, traditional boundaries begin to blend.
Staff is seconded from one department to another to share expertise. Digitization is mainstreamed
as part of normal processing activities. There is a learning and access officer for every collection to
help integrate collections into teaching. Students and faculty have the assistance they need to
create and disseminate new works of scholarship. All the information the institution produces and
publishes is harnessed, made accessible and preserved. Metrics are available to identify what is
important to users. The institution is a destination for civic information.

In the physical world, a “unified reading room” where users can access all campus collections and
that has shared exhibition space and adjacent classrooms streamlines use, while uniform
collections access and registration guidelines promote a sense of predictability and openness.
Shared spaces for conservation, storage, research and high-end and specialized digitization
leverage investments in expertise and space for all LAMs.
