Beyond the Silos of the LAMs: Collaboration Among Libraries, Archives and Museums

 

An Ideal World

“Part of my motivation is my son. | don’t want him to grow up thinking that Google and
Wikipedia and sources like that are the authoritative sources of information for him to do his
research when we have the capability [to provide better resources]. We’re sitting on what could
be a trusted digital repository that we could make available for every student, researcher, the
general public to take advantage of. For me, personally, | feel that there are very few times in life
when you’re in a position where you feel like you can make a real difference not only for the
organization you’re working for but for your country, and for your child. And | feel | am in that
particular role right now and have the opportunity to make those kinds of differences.”

During the workshops, participants from the five campuses articulated a vision of an ideal world,
free of obstacles and constraints. They often started by identifying a number of ways to improve
internal workflow and processes from their perspective as LAMs operating within the structure of a
parent organization, but quickly transitioned to a user point of view, thinking about improved
services and outcomes. What follows is not so much a consensus in which all workshop participants
shared, but a bricolage of commonly held views interspersed with some of the more interesting, if
less common, ideas.

The Vision

The ubiquity of online access inspires a vision of a single search across all collections, without
regard for where the assets are housed or what institutional unit oversees them. A “Google-like
search across our collections” showcases the compelling body of materials, extending the status of
“leading” and “foremost” collections in a particular area or discipline from the physical into the
virtual world. Incorporating other resources such as lectures, course content or educational
materials into the single search “promotes intellectual connections.” Searching by “my term, not
your term” yields satisfactory results for every interaction, while result sets including “forest” (broad)
and “tree” (specific) views allow multiple paths into the resources. Any desirable unit of information
is never more than “two clicks away,” allowing easy navigation through resources.

While pooled campus information offers end-users more seamless search experiences, it also yields
benefits in the day-to-day operations of LAMs, improving workflow and staff productivity through
integrated access. Creating exhibitions with campus materials, for example, will no longer rely ona
